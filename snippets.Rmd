```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Code will be written so that 




to auto generate letters you can use cldList from the rcompanion package
```{r}
library(rcompanion)


# auto generate sig letters
letter_contact<- dunn_test_output %>%
  unite(comparison, c(group1, group2), sep = "-")%>%
  cldList(p.adj ~ comparison, data = .)

```
The above code will work with dunn test by combining group 1 and goup 2 columns into 1 column. dont need unite line if using on Tukey which outputs single comparison column.
