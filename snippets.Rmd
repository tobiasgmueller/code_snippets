```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Code will be written so that 


clean environment
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```


correct all characters to factors
```{r}
read_csv("data.csv") %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, factor)
```


write file name from variable
```{r}

x = "name"

write_csv(df, file = paste("output/", x, "_more_information.csv", sep=""))

```



to auto generate letters you can use cldList from the rcompanion package
```{r}
library(rcompanion)


# auto generate sig letters
letter_contact<- dunn_test_output %>%
  unite(comparison, c(group1, group2), sep = "-")%>%
  cldList(p.adj ~ comparison, data = .)

```
The above code will work with dunn test by combining group 1 and goup 2 columns into 1 column. dont need unite line if using on Tukey which outputs single comparison column.
